# Student Financial Application  - UX Design Project
Welcome to SafeHawks, a UX design project focused on creating a safe and intuitive campus safety app for students at Laurier University. This project aims to improve student safety on campus by providing a comprehensive suite of safety features in one easy-to-use app.

## Features

Expense tracking: The app allows students to track their expenses by category, such as food, transportation, entertainment, and school supplies. Students can easily input their expenses and categorize them in the app, and view their spending history by category and over time.

Financial goal setting: The app allows students to set financial goals, such as saving for a trip or paying off student loans. Students can track their progress towards their goals and receive personalized recommendations for how to reach them faster.

Expense analysis: The app provides students with detailed analysis of their expenses and helps them identify areas where they can save money. For example, the app can show students how much they spend on eating out each month, and provide suggestions for how to cut down on that expense.

Customization: The app allows students to customize their experience by choosing their preferred currency, language, and categories for expenses.
